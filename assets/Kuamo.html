The forest sprang to life as the sun once again rose upon it. Out from under a tree hopped a small white rabbit. Nearby, a young girl laid eyes on it. She had short black hair, and wore a simple blue dress with white dots on it. Upon seeing this rabbit, the girl slowly walked closer and knelt down to pet it. The rabbit stilled as the young girl approached. It's eyes stayed on the girl's hand but made no effort to move. When her hand reached the rabbit, it stayed, and allowed the girl to stroke its silky fur.
</p>
<p>
The girl nearly gasped, but held it tight in her chest, not wanting to scare off the creature. She continued to pet the rabbit, and as she did, she saw flowers blooming around her, and the trees green in the middle of autumn. The young girl remained kneeling petting this snow-white rabbit in the midst of what seemed, to her, to be the forest come-to-life. The rabbit took a step closer to her. The girl hesitantly reached under the rabbit and lifted it off the ground. The rabbit remained calm, and relaxed as the girl took it into her arms.
</p>
<p>
The girl looked into the rabbit's dark, deep eyes and felt something speak to her.
</p>
<p>
"Kuamo," said the girl, remaining focused on the rabbit. "That's your name, isn't it?"
</p>
<p>
The rabbit Kuamo looked back blankly at the girl and seemed pleased. As the girl left the forest, it remained the same reddish-brown hue that had so eluded the young girlâ€™s eyes.
</p>
<p>
The girl took Kuamo and went back to where her house once stood, but was now a heap of still-warm ashes. She set Kuamo down and made play at pouring him a cup of tea.
</p>
<p>
"I'm sure you enjoy a cup of tea as much as the next person, don't you Kuamo?"
</p>
<p>
Kuamo looked up blankly at the girl as it sat in the ashes. The girl giggled. "Oh goodness! Kuamo you must leave some tea for the rest of the guests. They'll be arriving soon."
</p>
<p>
A faint breeze blew and ashes drifted away from the pile that had been the house only the night before. The sky too began to grey, dimming the sun. A tall figure stood in the distance, bringing the winds with him and as he drifted nearer, and the gust picked up.
</p>
<p>
"Kuamo!" said the girl as the winds picked up, "It seems there may be a storm on its way!" The girl's dress now waved in the air as she stood and looked toward the way the winds came. "Oh!" she said with delight, "Our guests are arriving!" The girl became ecstatic as the tall figure drew closer. He was a few hundred yards away now and could be made out to be wearing a dark suit. The winds picked up as the man drew closer, announcing his coming. The house was now almost completely blown away.
</p>
<p>
"What dreadful weather we've run into Kuamo. I'm so glad to be indoors on a day such as today." The girl continued playing at pouring tea for herself and Kuamo as she sat back down, though the wind was now so fierce that it brought tears to her eyes. No tears touched Kuamo's eyes, however. He sat next to her as still as a rabbit could be, with only the twitch of his nose to show he was indeed a real rabbit.
</p>
<p>
The man walked up, now only a few yards from the girl and Kuamo, though the ashes had long since blown away. There was now only a barren patch of dirt where the house had been, green grass pressing up to it. Even the man's suit flapped wildly in the strong wind that was blowing at his back. The girl smiled broadly.
</p>
<p>
The man stood at the place where the front door had resided and knocked on the air, though the sound of knuckle on wood ran out. The girl jumped up, ran over to him, and, grabbing the gilded knob she alone saw which she knew so well, opened the imagined door.
</p>
<p>
"Hello there, sir! What's your name?"
</p>
<p>
The man stood with gleaming pale blue eyes, and brown short hair combed nicely to the side. He smiled a toothy smile and the wind halted in an instant. "Hello my darling, I am Omauk." His voice rang deep and raspy in his chest. As he spoke the dimmed sky above stirred, becoming restless.
</p>
<p>
"Hello, Mr. Omauk, please come in!" she began to hold out her hand to lead him, but seemed to catch herself and instead simply walked before him. Omauk seemed concerned though he made no effort to take her hand unwilling. She lead him through the house-turned-desolation and to where Kuamo sat.
</p>
<p>
"I see you have started without me," Omauk said, with no real offense given.
</p>
<p>
"I have! My guests had grown a bit thirsty in waiting for the others to arrive. Would you like some tea?" She stared up at him, gesturing to her incorporeal teapot she held so deftly.
</p>
<p>
"I would love some!" said Omauk in a manner such as befit speaking to an old friend. He held out a hand holding a small white teacup with blue patterns scrolling along the rim. As the girl poured, his cup began filling with steaming hot tea. "Ah, I see you've kept it warm for us!"
</p>
<p>
"I did indeed! Though it took some doing. Mother wouldn't let me use the stove, so I had to keep it warm here in my bedroom."
</p>
<p>
A flash of sorrow washed over Omauk's face, and receded in an instant. "Ah, you are indeed a resourceful girl. Who, may I ask, is this?" asked Omauk, sliding his gaze to Kuamo.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, this is Kuamo," the girl said, patting Kuamo. For the first time since arriving at the ruin, Kuamo moved, turning his head and set his gaze on the new visitor.
</p>
<p>
Omauk nodded at the white rabbit who was now hopping towards the girl. "He seems very friendly, doesn't he?" Omauk's appearance maintained a friendly countenance, though his gaze fixed onto Kuamo with each movement. The clouds continued their roil above the party.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, he certainly is. Quite polite too."
</p>
<p>
Kuamo hopped into the girl's lap. As he did, the clouds seemed to pour out of each other and the sky took on a green hue as it darkened. No wind blew.
</p>
<p>
"Is he? He seems to not want the last of his tea. I always thought it quite rude to leave drink at such a fine party as this."
</p>
<p>
"There's no need for guests to drink more than they wish," said the girl smiling as she pet Kuamo. With each stroke, the man Omauk cringed slightly.
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, miss, the rest of the visitors will not be arriving here."
</p>
<p>
The girl looked up at Omauk confused. "What other guests should arrive?"
</p>
<p>
Omauk locked the girl's gaze as his eyes tensed. He glanced at Kuamo who still sat in the girl's lap staring at him. The girl's hand continued stroking Kuamo's silky fur, now causing the man apparent pain. Omauk stood stunned. His eyes began taking on the color of the sky and his voice seemed to shake the very essence of reality, "Your visitors are anxiously awaiting your arrival at my estate. I fear we must not keep them waiting any longer than we must." Each word came out like a rock covered in honey.
</p>
<p>
With his words, cracks appeared in the clouds and streams of light seemed to claw their way out but any shadows the light broke didn't enter the baren dirt spot which marked the footprint of the house which used to reside there. The girl blinked and glanced upwards but quickly went back to looking between the man and the rabbit which sat in her lap.
</p>
<p>
"Come now," said Omauk with a look of concern, "We really should be leaving. It even seems you are out of tea."
</p>
<p>
The girl picked up the fictitious tea pot and tipped it; after a moment she looked disgruntled. "So I am." She looked up at Omauk, "I guess we really should venture to your estate."
</p>
<p>
"Come now, my darling," he held his hand down to her and she reached for it. As his hand grew near, the tip of his finger became skeletal, showing bare rotting bone, and he pulled back. "I'm sorry, but you'll need to leave Kuamo here."
</p>
<p>
The girl shrank back, her hand retreating. She stared at Kuamo, but the rabbit would not take his gaze from Omauk.
</p>
<p>
"I'm sorry," started the girl, but the man interrupted.
</p>
<p>
"It's alright my dear, Kuamo is just not fit to partake in such an event that I have planned. The crowd which has gathered for you has already filled up the room to bursting! I'm sure your friend will understand. You will see him another time."
</p>
<p>
The girl made to put down Kuamo, but as she put her hands around him, she blinked as if remembering. "I'm sorry Mr. Omauk, but I'm afraid I won't be leaving Kuamo." The skin of Omauk's fingers once again began fading away, moving back until his entire finger showed bone. The girl noticed and gave a shout in fear. 
</p>
<p>
"What is happening to your fingers? Are you some monster?"
</p>
<p>
He looked down, noticing his condition and took a quick step back, but to no avail. His hand continued to take on the terrifying visage. The rabbit continued staring at the man as his appearance grew more and more grotesque. His face grew taut and pressed against his skull. Omauk turned to step away quickly, but when he did, there was a rhythmic tapping sound, followed by a crash of fine china.
</p>
<p>
The girl grew apparently upset. "And now, you're making a mess of my party. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave."
</p>
<p>
Omauk once again faced the girl, his face now returned to its handsome appearance took slow steps backwards, eyes locked on the rabbit which sat so calmly throughout the ordeal in the girl's lap. His rage began showing on his face and he clenched his fists looking at Kuamo.
</p>
<p>
Omauk screamed.
</p>
<p>
His scream seemed to tear open the world and shatter reality, as if we lived on a plane of glass and he were it's resonant frequency. It shook the girl and it shook even the rabbit. As it rang out, the darkening clouds in the sky opened and a bright shaft of light pierced down pointing squarely to the girl and Kuamo, though they remained sitting in shadow, unaware of anything outside of the faux tea party, except the shouting figure standing outside the house.
</p>
<p>
A tear dropped from Omauk's cheek. He turned and left the girl to enjoy her tea with the white rabbit Kuamo in the wreckage and remnants of what was once her home. Where inside should have been wooden floors, two loving parents, and the room of a single young child, with the name "Alliesan" hung on the door.
